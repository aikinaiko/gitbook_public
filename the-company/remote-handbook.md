# ðŸ—º Remote handbook

## Why?

### It can give Slite folks 10x better conditions

We believe remote can dramatically improve some of our employees' quality of life. Even more, some people need other work environments than Paris or San Francisco or an office in general to be fulfilled.

This advantage comes at some cost but it's by far the best reason to be remote-first.

### It's way easier to hire

This is obvious but being remote-compatible broadens our hiring possibilities. Since we're building something outstanding, we need outstanding people. Limiting ourselves to 1 culture, 1 limited set of people, 1 city would dramatically reduce our chances of success.

A side note: because remote can dramatically raise employees' quality of life, employee retention tends to be much higher, in turn simplifying hiring as well. It's a virtuous cycle.

### It improves the way we work

The main point here is that remote forces us to confront problems that could've arisen later. It pushes us to find long term solutions, early.

It mostly allows us reduce the chaotic aspect of small startup & produce with a better quality.

It forces us to communicate asynchronously. Without remote we would have liked doing it, because it means less meeting and better argumentation, but we would have given up way more easily.
